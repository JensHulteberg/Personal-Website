      "The PEP-device is a complex wearable that harvests the user's body heat in order to generate a personal storage of electricity. The stored electricity can then be consumed as the users see fit: powering their personal devices, sharing it with others, or selling the electricity back to the power grid.\n\n The PEP is a speculative design existing in a potential future where electricity is scarce and society has pivoten towards other more novel ways of producing electricity. The aim of the product is to explore our relationship towards technology, the bond between human and phone and the stresses of extensive technology use today. \n\n The PEP was created as part of my masters thesis at Chalmers University of Technology in collaboration with RISE (Research Institutes of Sweden). The artifact and the masters thesis was created by a two person team myself and Vendela Stensson.",

      "Wave labs is a connected system of vibrating media designed to make you curious to ask the first question of how and why things vibrate. Through the common medium of sound the system vibrates not only the air around you but also a liquid and a solid object. Through hearing, touch and vision you can experience the effect of the soundwaves with these different media. \n\n The Wave labs uses sound as the basis for learning. Thus it also uses a symbol for sound as a controller. By rotating a vinyl plate you can create all frequencies in the hearable spectrum. That same wavelength is then also applied to both a chladni plate and the water. This way a user gets direct feedback on how a wavelength interacts with different media. \n\n Our aim was, from start to finish, the creative learning experience one can have when exploring science. The system has no text or instructions, just a vinyl plate that can be rotated to create the wave. People approach the system eager to explore the soundscape and its interaction with the different media. But they leave it with a bit more understanding of what waves are and how they interact. \n\n Wave Labs was created as part of a course at Chalmers University of Technology under the theme of “visualizing the invisible”.

      "The Lazarus chair is a system that lets you remove your senses and leaves you alone with your own mind. The user puts on the helmet, sits down in the chair and by interacting with the controls get the power to turn on or off their own senses one by one. This will hopefully force the user to interact with their own mind as it is simply the only thing left to reflect on when the world is removed. \n\n The system has 4 buttons that disable one sense each. The buttons are located on the sphere at the end of one of the right arm-rests. The buttons are ranked in terms of “severity of the experience”: smell, then hearing, then sight and then touch. As touch is the last sense you lose it is also the one used to code the buttons. They are simply labeled with bumps for navigation without sight. The buttons work firstly as a protective frame as they give the user full control over the experience. But it is also important to have the agency of the system in the hands of the user. This way, the experience is owned by the user and thus hopefully a stronger one. \n\n The Lazarus Chair is a speculative design and it exists solely as a basis for discussion on the self and our reliance on our senses. It was created by me as part of a course at Chalmers University of Technology.",

    bread: 'Mutant UA is an integral part of my childhood and I often praise it as the best role playing game of all time. So when my online role playing group was looking for a new game to play I came up with the suggestion that maybe we should play this old gem. However we quickly realized that Mutant UA has no digital resources. We usually roleplay through the web-interface roll20.net and as it had no digital character sheet for Mutant UA I took it upon myself to create it. \n\n The process itself was quite simple, the character sheet is just html and css and uses roll20´s Character sheet enhancements that add general javascript functionality. Thus, sadly, this character sheet is currently only usable in the roll20 interface. \n\n I also took the opportunity to tweak/redesign some aspects of the Mutant UA character creation process. After all my years of playing the game two aspects of a Mutant character have always stood out to me as problematic. Firstly the over-reliance on the basic skill "Smidighet" (Agility) and secondly the general weakness of a fresh character. \n\n Thus I experimented a bit and came up with a couple of new skills as well as summarized a couple others in order to make other basic-skills outside of agility a bit more relevant. Furthermore I tweaked the way points are allocated during character creation to create characters that are experts in a few skills rather than mediocre in many. I would never say that my tweaks made the game better, but I do believe that it fit my roleplaying group a bit better to have clear areas of expertise and start the game as generally competent characters. \n\n The character-sheet is currently only for private use by me and my roleplaying group but I am hoping to one day make it available to the internet at large so that more people can play this great roleplaying game in a digital setting.',

      "In a small team of four I got the opportunity to work as a set designer for a new children's play called Drömarkivet “The Dream Archive”. As the play would be moving around a lot I worked with the restraint of making the set easy to assemble and disassemble but still inspiring enough to keep the children interested. \n\n Working with inspiration from dusty archives and the dreams of children, I created the place of the Dream Archive where children's dreams were stored in glass jars in the form of luminescent slime. \n\n The set also had several technical solutions and challenges stemming from the interactivity of the luminescent slime and the rather small team. I implemented a system that would allow the actors to control both the scene lighting and the lighting of the slime with tiny remotes that could be hidden on their person.",
