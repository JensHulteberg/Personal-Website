			"The PEP-device is a complex wearable that harvests the user's body heat in order to generate a personal storage of electricity. The stored electricity can then be consumed as the users see fit: powering their personal devices, sharing it with others, or selling the electricity back to the power grid.\n\n The PEP is a speculative design existing in a potential future where electricity is scarse and society had pivoten towards other more novel ways of producing electricity. The aim of the product is to explore our relationship towards technology, the bond between human and phone and the stresses of extensive technology use today. \n\n The PEP was created as part of my masters thesis at Chalmers University of Technology. The artifact and the masters thesis was created in colaboration with Vendela Stensson.",

			"Wave labs is a connected system of vibrating media designed to make you curious to ask the first question of how and why things vibrate. Through the common medium of sound the system vibrates not only the air around you but also a liquid and a solid object. Through hearing, touch and vision you can experience the effect of the soundwaves with these different medias. \n\n The Wave labs uses sound as the basis for learning. Thus it also uses a symbol for sound as a controller. By rotating a vinyl plate you can create all frequencies in the hearable spectrum. That same wavelength is then also applied to both a chladni plate and the water. This way a user gets direct feedback on how a wavelength interacts with different media. \n\n Our aim was from start to finish the creative learning experience one can have when exploring science. The system has no text or instructions just a vinyl plate that can be rotated to create the wave. People approach the sytem eager to explore the soundscape and its interaction with the different media. But they leave it with a bit more understanding of what waves are and how they interact.",

The goal of the website is to provide informational and trustworthy guidance to help travellers make informed decisions and plan their vacations in advance. The site also works as a web shop, where it is possible to book and buy interrail tickets for a future vacation. Tågluffaieuropa.se is made with React and JavaScript and uses a MySQL-database to store relevant information. \n\n Tagluffaieuropa.se is an active project and the site is still in development. The current build can be found through the external link provided bellow.",

			"The Lazarus chair is a system that lets you remove your senses and leaves you alone with your own mind. The user puts on the helmet, sits down in the chair and by interacting with the controls get the power to turn on or off their own senses one by one. This will hopefully force the user to interact with their own mind as it is simply the only thing left to reflect on when the world is removed. \n\n The system has 4 buttons that disable one sense each. The buttons are located on the sphere at the end of one of the right arm-rests. The buttons are ranked in terms of “severity of the experience”: smell, then hearing, then sight and then touch. As touch is the last sense you lose it is also the one used to code the buttons. They are simply labeled with bumps for navigation without sight. The buttons work firstly as protective frame as they give the user full control over the experience [4]. But it is also important to have the agency of the system in the hands of the user. This way, the experience is owned by the user and thus hopefully a stronger one.",

All this without a single instruction and only one line of feedback, that is the light strip that mimics the active light source intensity and color. \n\n The FluxWheel contains a complex combintation of rotary-encoders and gyroscopes that facilitates the interactions and can thus be both spun and flipped without needing any kind of external sensor or base-station.",

In this godforsaken place, two ancient wizards rise from the grave, on All Hallows' Eve, to duke it out in an all-out, fireball-fueled wizard battle. Caught in the crossfire of this ancient grudge are the villagers. These peaceful skeletons and humans, friends by day, are at night forced by the wizards into a terrible battle. \n\n In this two-player nightmare, take up arms as Malufix, the Wizard of Light, or his immortal enemy, the Dark Warlock Bulfass. Burn your enemies and be the lone winner when the sun's first rays break the dawn. Who will win and become The King of Wizards?",
