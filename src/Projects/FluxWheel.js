						"Fluxwheel is an IOT (internet of things) light controller that  uses simple tanglible interactions to modfiy lighting in a domestic enviorment. \n\n By spinning, flipping and shaking the token a user can select an active light, turn it on and change both color and intensity of the light source. All this without a single instruction and only one line of feedback, that is the light strip that mimics the active light source intensity and color. \n\n The FluxWheel contains a complex combintation of rotary-encoders and gyroscopes that facilitates the interactions and can thus be both spun and flipped without needing any kind of external sensor or base-station."
